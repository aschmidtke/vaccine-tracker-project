VaxTrax
The COVID-19 pandemic has required us all to make adjustments to our everyday lives and one of these adjustments is having to provide proof vaccination. Whether itâ€™s dining out, going to a concert or traveling, being able to readily prove your vaccination status is now commonplace. To help with these cases, we have developed VaxTrax where users can store all of their vaccination data and present that data in an easy-to-read digital card.
